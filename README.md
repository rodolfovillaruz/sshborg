## Features

- **SSH terminal** — VT100/xterm emulation, full UTF-8, multiple concurrent sessions
- **SFTP file manager** — browse, upload, download, rename, and delete files
- **SSH key auth** — generate Ed25519, ECDSA, and RSA keys directly on device
- **Jump host support** — connect through one or more bastion hosts with transparent tunnelling
- **SSH agent forwarding** — forward your keys through jump chains
- **Biometric lock** — protect access with fingerprint or face unlock
- **Backup / restore** — export and import host configurations as JSON (credentials excluded)
- **No ads, no tracking, no third-party SDKs**

Requires Android 10 (API 29) or later.

## Building

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/payne1982/sshborg.git
cd sshborg

# Copy the example config and set your SDK path
cp local.properties.example local.properties
# edit local.properties: set sdk.dir or export ANDROID_HOME=/path/to/sdk

# Build a debug APK
JAVA_HOME=/path/to/jdk21 ./gradlew assembleDebug
```

A release build additionally requires signing configuration in `local.properties` (not tracked):

```
signing.storeFile=/path/to/keystore.jks
signing.storePassword=...
signing.keyAlias=...
signing.keyPassword=...
```

## Releasing

CI runs on every push and PR to `V1` and `V1_DEV` (lint, unit tests, debug build — see `.github/workflows/ci.yml`).

Pushing a `v*.*.*` tag (e.g. `v1.18.0`) triggers `.github/workflows/release.yml`, which builds a signed release APK and publishes it as a GitHub Release. It needs four repository secrets to run:

- `ANDROID_KEYSTORE_BASE64` — the release keystore, base64-encoded (`base64 -w0 your.jks`)
- `ANDROID_KEYSTORE_PASSWORD`
- `ANDROID_KEY_ALIAS`
- `ANDROID_KEY_PASSWORD`

Without them the workflow skips instead of failing, so tagging is safe even before signing is set up.

## iOS version

Looking for the iOS repository? It is [payne1982/sshborg-ios](https://github.com/payne1982/sshborg-ios) — a separate app, written from scratch in Swift, sharing this one's design, its ten languages and its backup format.
